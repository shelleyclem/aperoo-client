# Apéroo: A React Legacy App using TypeScript.

Apéroo is a happy hour/cocktail logging app, and it is the capstone project for my RedBadge at ElevenFifty Academy. The client has 10 endpoints--two for Registration and Login, and 4 CRUD endpoints for both the Drink and Bar Review tables.

### Notes
While building this project, I was tempted to omit TypeScript and class components altogether. While this version of Apéroo is not at all what I had envisioned visually or functionally, I am proud that I was able to face the hardest parts of the assignment and ultimately learn more about TypeScript and React Legacy code.
